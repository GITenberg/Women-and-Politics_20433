<p>Somewhat more than 300 years ago, John Knox, who did more than
any man to mould the thoughts of his nation&mdash;and indeed of 
our English Puritans likewise&mdash;was writing a little book on 
the &lsquo;Regiment of Women,&rsquo; in which he proved woman, on
account of her natural inferiority to man, unfit to rule.</p>
<p>And but the other day, Mr. John Stuart Mill, who has done more
than any man to mould the thought of the rising generation of 
Englishmen, has written a little book, in the exactly opposite 
sense, on the &lsquo;Subjection of Women,&rsquo; in which he 
proves woman, on account of her natural equality with man, to be 
fit to rule.</p>
<p>Truly &lsquo;the whirligig of Time brings round its 
revenges.&rsquo;&nbsp; To this point the reason of civilised 
nations has come, or at least is coming fast, after some fifteen 
hundred years of unreason, and of a literature of unreason, which
discoursed gravely and learnedly of nuns and witches, hysteria 
and madness, persecution and torture, and, like a madman in his 
dreams, built up by irrefragable logic a whole inverted pyramid 
of seeming truth upon a single false premiss.&nbsp; To this it 
has come, after long centuries in which woman was regarded by 
celibate theologians as the &lsquo;noxious animal,&rsquo; <!-- 
page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>the
temptress, the source of earthly misery, which derived&mdash;at 
least in one case&mdash;&lsquo;femina&rsquo; from 
&lsquo;fe&rsquo; faith, and &lsquo;minus&rsquo; less, because 
women had less faith than men; which represented them as of more 
violent and unbridled animal passions; which explained learnedly 
why they were more tempted than men to heresy and witchcraft, and
more subject (those especially who had beautiful hair) to the 
attacks of demons; and, in a word, regarded them as a necessary 
evil, to be tolerated, despised, repressed, and if possible shut 
up in nunneries.</p>
<p>Of this literature of celibate unreason, those who have no 
time to read for themselves the pages of Sprenger, Meier, or 
Delrio the Jesuit, may find notices enough in Michelet, and in 
both Mr. Lecky&rsquo;s excellent works.&nbsp; They may find 
enough of it, and to spare also, in Burton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Anatomy
of Melancholy.&rsquo;&nbsp; He, like Knox, and many another 
scholar of the 16th and of the first half of the 17th century, 
was unable to free his brain altogether from the <i>idola 
spec&ucirc;s</i> which haunted the cell of the bookworm.&nbsp; 
The poor student, knowing nothing of women, save from books or 
from contact with the most debased, repeated, with the pruriency 
of a boy, the falsehoods about women which, armed with the 
authority of learned doctors, had grown reverend and 
incontestable with age; and even after the Reformation more than 
one witch-mania proved that the corrupt tree had vitality enough 
left to bring forth evil fruit.</p>
<p>But the axe had been laid to the root thereof.&nbsp; The later
witch prosecutions were not to be compared for extent and 
atrocity to the medi&aelig;val ones; and first, as it would seem,
in France, and gradually in other European <!-- page 5--><a 
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>countries, the 
old contempt of women was being replaced by admiration and 
trust.&nbsp; Such examples as that of Marguerite 
d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me did much, especially in the South of 
France, where science, as well as the Bible, was opening 
men&rsquo;s eyes more and more to nature and to fact.&nbsp; Good 
little Rondelet, or any of his pupils, would have as soon thought
of burning a woman for a witch as they would have of immuring her
in a nunnery.</p>
<p>In Scotland, John Knox&rsquo;s book came, happily for the 
nation, too late.&nbsp; The woes of Mary Stuart called out for 
her a feeling of chivalry which has done much, even to the 
present day, to elevate the Scotch character.&nbsp; Meanwhile, 
the same influences which raised the position of women among the 
Reformed in France raised it likewise in Scotland; and there is 
no country on earth in which wives and mothers have been more 
honoured, and more justly honoured, for two centuries and 
more.&nbsp; In England, the passionate loyalty with which 
Elizabeth was regarded, at least during the latter part of her 
reign, scattered to the winds all John Knox&rsquo;s arguments 
against the &lsquo;Regiment of Women;&rsquo; and a literature 
sprang up in which woman was set forth no longer as the weakling 
and the temptress, but as the guide and the inspirer of 
man.&nbsp; Whatever traces of the old foul leaven may be found in
Beaumont and Fletcher, Massinger, or Ben Jonson, such books as 
Sidney&rsquo;s &lsquo;Arcadia,&rsquo; Lyly&rsquo;s 
&lsquo;Euphues,&rsquo; Spenser&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fairy Queen,&rsquo;
and last, but not least, Shakespeare&rsquo;s Plays, place the 
conception of woman and of the rights of woman on a 
vantage-ground from which I believe it can never permanently fall
again&mdash;at least until (which God forbid) true manhood has 
died out of England.&nbsp; To a boy whose notions of his duty to 
woman had been <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>formed, not on Horace and Juvenal, but
on Spenser and Shakespeare,&mdash;as I trust they will be some 
day in every public school,&mdash;Mr. John Stuart Mill&rsquo;s 
new book would seem little more than a text-book of truths which 
had been familiar and natural to him ever since he first stood by
his mother&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>I say this not in depreciation of Mr. Mill&rsquo;s book.&nbsp;
I mean it for the very highest praise.&nbsp; M. Agassiz says 
somewhere that every great scientific truth must go through three
stages of public opinion.&nbsp; Men will say of it, first, that 
it is not true; next, that it is contrary to religion; and 
lastly, that every one knew it already.&nbsp; The last assertion 
of the three is often more than half true.&nbsp; In many cases 
every one ought to have known the truth already, if they had but 
used their common sense.&nbsp; The great antiquity of the earth 
is a case in point.&nbsp; Forty years ago it was still untrue; 
five-and-twenty years ago it was still contrary to 
religion.&nbsp; Now every child who uses his common sense can 
see, from looking at the rocks and stones about him, that the 
earth is many thousand, it may be many hundreds of thousands of 
years old; and there is no difficulty now in making him convince 
himself, by his own eyes and his own reason, of the most 
prodigious facts of the glacial epoch.</p>
<p>And so it ought to be with the truths which Mr. Mill has set 
forth.&nbsp; If the minds of lads can but be kept clear of Pagan 
brutalities and medi&aelig;val superstitions, and fed instead on 
the soundest and noblest of our English literature, Mr. 
Mill&rsquo;s creed about women will, I verily believe, seem to 
them as one which they have always held by instinct; as a natural
deduction from their own intercourse with their mothers, their 
aunts, <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>their sisters: and thus Mr. Mill&rsquo;s book may achieve
the highest triumph of which such a book is capable; 
namely&mdash;that years hence young men will not care to read it,
because they take it all for granted.</p>
<p>There are those who for years past have held opinions 
concerning women identical with those of Mr. Mill.&nbsp; They 
thought it best, however, to keep them to themselves; trusting to
the truth of the old saying, &lsquo;Run not round after the 
world.&nbsp; If you stand still long enough, the world will come 
round to you.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the world seems now to be coming 
round very fast towards their standing-point; and that not from 
theory, but from experience.&nbsp; As to the intellectual 
capacity of girls when competing with boys (and I may add as to 
the prudence of educating boys and girls together), the 
experience of those who for twenty years past have kept up mixed 
schools, in which the farmer&rsquo;s daughter has sat on the same
bench with the labourer&rsquo;s son, has been corroborated by all
who have tried mixed classes, or have, like the Cambridge local 
examiners, applied to the powers of girls the same tests as they 
applied to boys; and still more strikingly by the results of 
admitting women to the Royal College of Science in Ireland, where
young ladies have repeatedly carried off prizes for scientific 
knowledge against young men who have proved themselves, by 
subsequent success in life, to have been formidable rivals.&nbsp;
On every side the conviction seems growing (a conviction which 
any man might have arrived at for himself long ago, if he would 
have taken the trouble to compare the powers of his own daughters
with those of his sons), that there is no difference in kind, and
probably none in degree, between the intellect of a woman and 
that of a man; <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>and those who will not as yet assent 
to this are growing more willing to allow fresh experiments on 
the question, and to confess that, after all (as Mr. Fitch well 
says in his report to the Schools Inquiry Commission), &lsquo;The
true measure of a woman&rsquo;s right to knowledge is her 
capacity for receiving it, and not any theories of ours as to 
what she is fit for, or what use she is likely to make of 
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is, doubtless, a most important concession.&nbsp; For if 
it be allowed to be true of woman&rsquo;s capacity for learning, 
it ought to be&mdash;and I believe will be&mdash;allowed to be 
true of all her other capacities whatsoever.&nbsp; From which 
fresh concession results will follow, startling no doubt to those
who fancy that the world always was, and always will be, what it 
was yesterday and to-day: but results which some who have 
contemplated them steadily and silently for years past, have 
learnt to look at not with fear and confusion, but with earnest 
longing and high hope.</p>
<p>However startling these results may be, it is certain from the
books, the names whereof head this article, that some who desire 
their fulfilment are no mere fanatics or dreamers.&nbsp; They 
evince, without exception, that moderation which is a proof of 
true earnestness.&nbsp; Mr. Mill&rsquo;s book it is almost an 
impertinence in me to praise.&nbsp; I shall not review it in 
detail.&nbsp; It is known, I presume, to every reader of this 
Magazine, either by itself or reviews: but let me remind those 
who only know the book through reviews, that those reviews 
(however able or fair) are most probably written by men of 
inferior intellect to Mr. Mill, and by men who have not thought 
over the subject as long and as deeply as he has done; and that, 
therefore, if <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>they wish to know what Mr. Mill 
thinks, it would be wisest for them to read Mr. Mill 
himself&mdash;a truism which (in these days of second-hand 
knowledge) will apply to a good many books beside.&nbsp; But if 
they still fancy that the advocates of &lsquo;Woman&rsquo;s 
Rights&rsquo; in England are of the same temper as certain female
clubbists in America, with whose sayings and doings the public 
has been amused or shocked, then I beg them to peruse the article
on the &lsquo;Social Position of Women,&rsquo; by Mr. Boyd 
Kinnear; to find any fault with it they can; and after that, to 
show cause why it should not be reprinted (as it ought to be) in 
the form of a pamphlet, and circulated among the working men of 
Britain to remind them that their duty toward woman coincides (as
to all human duties) with their own palpable interest.&nbsp; I 
beg also attention to Dr. Hodgson&rsquo;s little book, 
&lsquo;Lectures on the Education of Girls, and Employment of 
Women;&rsquo; and not only to the text, but to the valuable notes
and references which accompany them.&nbsp; Or if any one wish to 
ascertain the temper, as well as the intellectual calibre of the 
ladies who are foremost in this movement, let them read, as 
specimens of two different styles, the Introduction to 
&lsquo;Woman&rsquo;s Work, and Woman&rsquo;s Culture,&rsquo; by 
Mrs. Butler, and the article on &lsquo;Female Suffrage,&rsquo; by
Miss Wedgewood, at p. 247.&nbsp; I only ask that these two 
articles should be judged on their own merits&mdash;the fact that
they are written by women being ignored meanwhile.&nbsp; After 
that has been done, it may be but just and right for the man who 
has read them to ask himself (especially if he has had a mother),
whether women who can so think and write, have not a right to 
speak, and a right to be heard when they speak, of a subject with
which <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>they must be better acquainted than 
men&mdash;woman&rsquo;s capacities, and woman&rsquo;s needs?</p>
<p>If any one who has not as yet looked into this 
&lsquo;Woman&rsquo;s Question&rsquo; wishes to know how it has 
risen to the surface just now, let them consider these words of 
Mrs. Butler.&nbsp; They will prove, at least, that the movement 
has not had its origin in the study, but in the market; not from 
sentimental dreams or abstract theories, but from the necessities
of physical fact:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The census taken eight years ago gave three
and a half millions of women in England working for a 
subsistence; and of these two and a half millions were 
unmarried.&nbsp; In the interval between the census of 1851 and 
that of 1861, the number of self-supporting women had increased 
by more than half a million.&nbsp; This is significant; and still
more striking, I believe, on this point, will be the returns of 
the nest census two years hence.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus a demand for employment has led naturally to a demand for
improved education, fitting woman for employment; and that again 
has led, naturally also, to a demand on the part of many 
thoughtful women for a share in making those laws and those 
social regulations which have, while made exclusively by men, 
resulted in leaving women at a disadvantage at every turn.&nbsp; 
They ask&mdash;and they have surely some cause to ask&mdash;What 
greater right have men to dictate to women the rules by which 
they shall live, than women have to dictate to men?&nbsp; All 
they demand&mdash;all, at least, that is demanded in the volumes 
noticed in this review&mdash;is fair play for women; &lsquo;A 
clear stage and no favour.&rsquo;&nbsp; Let &lsquo;natural 
selection,&rsquo; as Miss Wedgwood well says, decide which is the
superior, and in what.&nbsp; Let it, by <!-- page 11--><a 
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>the laws of 
supply and demand, draught women as well as men into the 
employments and positions for which they are most fitted by 
nature.&nbsp; To those who believe that the laws of nature are 
the laws of God, the <i>Vox Dei in rebus revelata</i>; that to 
obey them is to prove our real faith in God, to interfere with 
them (as we did in social relations throughout the Middle Ages, 
and as we did till lately in commercial relations likewise) by 
arbitrary restrictions is to show that we have no faith in God, 
and consider ourselves wise enough to set right an ill-made 
universe&mdash;to them at least this demand must seem both just 
and modest.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many women, and some men also, think the social 
status of women is just now in special peril.&nbsp; The late 
extension of the franchise has admitted to a share in framing our
laws many thousands of men of that class which&mdash;whatever be 
their other virtues, and they are many&mdash;is most given to 
spending their wives&rsquo; earnings in drink, and personally 
maltreating them; and least likely&mdash;to judge from the 
actions of certain trades&mdash;to admit women to free 
competition for employment.&nbsp; Further extension of the 
suffrage will, perhaps, in a very few years, admit many thousands
more.&nbsp; And it is no wonder if refined and educated women, in
an age which is disposed to see in the possession of a vote the 
best means of self-defence, should ask for votes, for the 
defence, not merely of themselves, but of their lowlier sisters, 
from the tyranny of men who are as yet&mdash;to the shame of the 
State&mdash;most of them altogether uneducated.</p>
<p>As for the reasonableness of such a demand, I can only 
say&mdash;what has been said elsewhere&mdash;that the present 
state of things, &lsquo;in which the franchise is considered <!--
page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
12</span>as something so important and so sacred that the most 
virtuous, the most pious, the most learned, the most wealthy, the
most benevolent, the most justly powerful woman, is refused it, 
as something too precious for her; and yet it is entrusted, 
freely and hopefully, to any illiterate, drunken, wife-beating 
ruffian who can contrive to keep a home over his head,&rsquo; is 
equally unjust and absurd.</p>
<p>There may be some sufficient answer to the conclusion which 
conscience and common sense, left to themselves, would draw from 
this statement of the case as it now stands: but none has 
occurred to me which is not contrary to the first principle of a 
free government.</p>
<p>This I presume to be: that every citizen has a right to share 
in choosing those who make the laws; in order to prevent, as far 
as he can, laws being made which are unjust and injurious to him,
to his family, or to his class; and that all are to be considered
as &lsquo;active&rsquo; citizens, save the criminal, the insane, 
or those unable to support themselves.&nbsp; The best rough test 
of a man&rsquo;s being able to support himself is, I doubt not, 
his being able to keep a house over his head, or, at least, a 
permanent lodging; and that, I presume, will be in a few years 
the one and universal test of active citizenship, unless we 
should meanwhile obtain the boon of a compulsory Government 
education, and an educational franchise founded thereon.&nbsp; 
But, it must be asked&mdash;and answered also&mdash;What is there
in such a test, even as it stands now, only partially applied, 
which is not as fair for women as it is for men?&nbsp; &lsquo;Is 
it just that an educated man, who is able independently to earn 
his own livelihood, should have a vote: but that an equally <!-- 
page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
13</span>educated woman, equally able independently to earn her 
own livelihood, should not?&nbsp; Is it just that a man owning a 
certain quantity of property should have a vote in respect of 
that property: but that a woman owning the same quantity of 
property, and perhaps a hundred or a thousand times more, should 
have no vote?&rsquo;&nbsp; What difference, founded on Nature and
Fact, exists between the two cases?</p>
<p>If it be said that Nature and Fact (arguments grounded on 
aught else are to be left to monks and medi&aelig;val jurists) 
prove that women are less able than men to keep a house over 
their head, or to manage their property, the answer is that Fact 
is the other way.&nbsp; Women are just as capable as men of 
managing a large estate, a vast wealth.&nbsp; Mr. Mill gives a 
fact which surprised even him&mdash;that the best administered 
Indian States were those governed by women who could neither read
nor write, and were confined all their lives to the privacy of 
the harem.&nbsp; And any one who knows the English upper classes 
must know more than one illustrious instance&mdash;besides that 
of Miss Burdett Coutts, or the late Dowager Lady 
Londonderry&mdash;in which a woman has proved herself able to use
wealth and power as well, or better, than most men.&nbsp; The 
woman at least is not likely, by gambling, horseracing, and 
profligacy, to bring herself and her class to shame.&nbsp; Women,
too, in every town keep shops.&nbsp; Is there the slightest 
evidence that these shops are not as well managed, and as 
remunerative, as those kept by men?&mdash;unless, indeed, as too 
often happens, poor Madame has her Mantalini and his vices to 
support, as well as herself and her children.&nbsp; As for the 
woman&rsquo;s power of supporting herself and keeping up at least
a lodging <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>respectably, can any one have lived 
past middle age without meeting dozens of single women, or 
widows, of all ranks, who do that, and do it better and more 
easily than men, because they do not, like men, require wine, 
beer, tobacco, and sundry other luxuries?&nbsp; So wise and 
thrifty are such women, that very many of them are able, out of 
their own pittance, to support beside themselves others who have 
no legal claim upon them.&nbsp; Who does not know, if he knows 
anything of society, the truth of Mr. Butler&rsquo;s 
words?&mdash;&lsquo;It is a very generally accepted axiom, and 
one which it seems has been endorsed by thoughtful men, without a
sufficiently minute examination into the truth of it, that a 
man&mdash;in the matter of maintenance&mdash;means generally a 
man, a wife and children; while a woman means herself alone, free
of dependence.&nbsp; A closer inquiry into the facts of life 
would prove that conclusions have been too hastily adopted on the
latter head.&nbsp; I believe it may be said with truth that there
is scarcely a female teacher in England, who is not working for 
another or others besides herself,&mdash;that a very large 
proportion are urged on of necessity in their work by the 
dependence on them of whole families, in many cases of their own 
aged parents,&mdash;that many hundreds are keeping broken-down 
relatives, fathers, and brothers, out of the workhouse, and that 
many are widows supporting their own children.&nbsp; A few 
examples, taken at random from the lists of governesses applying 
to the Institution in Sackville Street, London, would illustrate 
this point.&nbsp; And let it be remembered that such cases are 
the rule, and not the exception.&nbsp; Indeed, if the facts of 
life were better known, the hollowness of this defence of the 
inequality of payment would become manifest; for it <!-- page 
15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>is in
theory alone that in families man is the only bread-winner, and 
it is false to suppose that single women have no obligations to 
make and to save money as sacred as those which are imposed on a 
man by marriage; while there is this difference, that a man may 
avoid such obligation if he pleases, by refraining from marriage,
while the poverty of parents, or the dependence of brothers and 
sisters, are circumstances over which a woman obliged to work for
others has no control.&rsquo;</p>
<p>True: and, alas! too true.&nbsp; But what Mr. Butler asserts 
of governesses may be asserted, with equal truth, of hundreds of 
maiden aunts and maiden sisters who are not engaged in teaching, 
but who spend their money, their time, their love, their 
intellect, upon profligate or broken-down relations, or upon 
their children; and who exhibit through long years of toil, 
anxiety, self-sacrifice, a courage, a promptitude, a knowledge of
business and of human nature, and a simple but lofty standard of 
duty and righteousness, which if it does not fit them for the 
franchise, what can?</p>
<p>It may be, that such women would not care to use the 
franchise, if they had it.&nbsp; That is their concern, not 
ours.&nbsp; Voters who do not care to vote may be counted by 
thousands among men; some of them, perhaps, are wiser than their 
fellows, and not more foolish; and take that method of showing 
their wisdom.&nbsp; Be that as it may, we are no more justified 
in refusing a human being a right, because he may not choose to 
exercise it, than we are in refusing to pay him his due, because 
he may probably hoard the money.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
16</span>The objection that such women are better without a vote,
because a vote would interest them in politics, and so interfere 
with their domestic duties, seems slender enough.&nbsp; What 
domestic duties have they, of which the State can take 
cognisance, save their duty to those to whom they may owe money, 
and their duty to keep the peace?&nbsp; Their other and nobler 
duties are voluntary and self-imposed; and, most usually, are 
fulfilled as secretly as possible.&nbsp; The State commits an 
injustice in debarring a woman from the rights of a citizen 
because she chooses, over and above them, to perform the good 
works of a saint.</p>
<p>And, after all, will it be the worse for these women, or for 
the society in which they live, if they do interest themselves in
politics?&nbsp; Might not (as Mr. Boyd Kinnear urges in an 
article as sober and rational as it is earnest and chivalrous) 
their purity and earnestness help to make what is now called 
politics somewhat more pure, somewhat more earnest?&nbsp; Might 
not the presence of the voting power of a few virtuous, 
experienced, well-educated women, keep candidates, for very 
shame, from saying and doing things from which they do not 
shrink, before a crowd of men who are, on the average, neither 
virtuous, experienced, or well-educated, by wholesome dread of 
that most terrible of all earthly punishments&mdash;at least in 
the eyes of a manly man&mdash;the fine scorn of a noble 
woman?&nbsp; Might not the intervention of a few women who are 
living according to the eternal laws of God, help to infuse some 
slightly stronger tincture of those eternal laws into our 
legislators and their legislation?&nbsp; What women have done for
the social reforms of the last forty years is known, or ought to 
be known, to all.&nbsp; <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Might not they have done far more, 
and might not they do far more hereafter, if they, who generally 
know far more than men do of human suffering, and of the 
consequences of human folly, were able to ask for further social 
reforms, not merely as a boon to be begged from the physically 
stronger sex, but as their will, which they, as citizens, have a 
right to see fulfilled, if just and possible?&nbsp; Woman has 
played for too many centuries the part which Lady Godiva plays in
the old legend.&nbsp; It is time that she should not be content 
with mitigating by her entreaties or her charities the cruelty 
and greed of men, but exercise her right, as a member of the 
State, and (as I believe) a member of Christ and a child of God, 
to forbid them.</p>
<p>As for any specific difference between the intellect of women 
and that of men, which should preclude the former meddling in 
politics, I must confess that the subtle distinctions drawn, even
by those who uphold the intellectual equality of women, have 
almost, if not altogether, escaped me.&nbsp; The only important 
difference, I think, is, that men are generally duller and more 
conceited than women.&nbsp; The dulness is natural enough, on the
broad ground that the males of all animals (being more sensual 
and selfish) are duller than the females.&nbsp; The conceit is 
easily accounted for.&nbsp; The English boy is told from 
childhood, as the negro boy is, that men are superior to 
women.&nbsp; The negro boy shows his assent to the proposition by
beating his mother, the English one by talking down his 
sisters.&nbsp; That is all.</p>
<p>But if there be no specific intellectual difference (as there 
is actually none), is there any practical and moral 
difference?&nbsp; I use the two epithets as synonymous; <!-- page
18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>for 
practical power may exist without acuteness of intellect: but it 
cannot exist without sobriety, patience, and courage, and sundry 
other virtues, which are &lsquo;moral&rsquo; in every sense of 
that word.</p>
<p>I know of no such difference.&nbsp; There are, doubtless, 
fields of political action more fitted for men than for women; 
but are there not again fields more fitted for women than for 
men?&mdash;fields in which certain women, at least, have already 
shown such practical capacity, that they have established not 
only their own right, but a general right for the able and 
educated of their sex, to advise officially about that which they
themselves have unofficially mastered.&nbsp; Who will say that 
Mrs. Fry, or Miss Nightingale, or Miss Burdett Coutts, is not as 
fit to demand pledges of a candidate at the hustings on important
social questions as any male elector; or to give her deliberate 
opinion thereon in either House of Parliament, as any average 
M.P. or peer of the realm?&nbsp; And if it be said that these are
only brilliant exceptions, the rejoinder is, What proof have you 
of that?&nbsp; You cannot pronounce on the powers of the average 
till you have tried them.&nbsp; These exceptions rather prove the
existence of unsuspected and unemployed strength below.&nbsp; If 
a few persons of genius, in any class, succeed in breaking 
through the barriers of routine and prejudice, their success 
shows that they have left behind them many more who would follow 
in their steps if those barriers were but removed.&nbsp; This has
been the case in every forward movement, religious, scientific, 
or social.&nbsp; A daring spirit here and there has shown his 
fellow-men what could be known, what could be done; and behold, 
when once awakened to a sense of their own powers, multitudes 
<!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
19</span>have proved themselves as capable, though not as daring,
as the leaders of their forlorn hope.&nbsp; Dozens of geologists 
can now work out problems which would have puzzled Hutton or 
Werner; dozens of surgeons can perform operations from which John
Hunter would have shrunk appalled; and dozens of women, were they
allowed, would, I believe, fulfil in political and official posts
the hopes which Miss Wedgwood and Mr. Boyd Kinnear entertain.</p>
<p>But, after all, it is hard to say anything on this matter, 
which has not been said in other words by Mr. Mill himself, in 
pp. 98-104 of his &lsquo;Subjection of Women;&rsquo; or give us 
more sound and palpable proof of women&rsquo;s political 
capacity, than the paragraph with which he ends his 
argument:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Is it reasonable to think that those who 
are fit for the greater functions of politics are incapable of 
qualifying themselves for the less?&nbsp; Is there any reason, in
the nature of things, that the wives and sisters of princes 
should, whenever called on, be found as competent as the princes 
themselves to their business, but that the wives and sisters of 
statesmen, and administrators, and directors of companies, and 
managers of public institutions, should be unable to do what is 
done by their brothers and husbands?&nbsp; The real reason is 
plain enough; it is that princesses, being more raised above the 
generality of men by their rank than placed below them by their 
sex, have never been taught that it was improper for them to 
concern themselves with politics; but have been allowed to feel 
the liberal interest natural to any cultivated human being, in 
the great transactions which took place around them, and in which
they might be called on to take a part.&nbsp; The ladies of 
reigning <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>families are the only women who are 
allowed the same range of interests and freedom of development as
men; and it is precisely in their case that there is not found to
be any inferiority.&nbsp; Exactly where and in proportion as 
women&rsquo;s capacities for government have been tried, in that 
proportion have they been found adequate.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though the demands of women just now are generally urged in 
the order of&mdash;first, employment, then education, and lastly,
the franchise, I have dealt principally with the latter, because 
I sincerely believe that it, and it only, will lead to their 
obtaining a just measure of the two former.&nbsp; Had I been 
treating of an ideal, or even a truly civilised polity, I should 
have spoken of education first; for education ought to be the 
necessary and sole qualification for the franchise.&nbsp; But we 
have not so ordered it in England in the case of men; and in all 
fairness we ought not to do so in the case of women.&nbsp; We 
have not so ordered it, and we had no right to order it otherwise
than we have done.&nbsp; If we have neglected to give the masses 
due education, we have no right to withhold the franchise on the 
strength of that neglect.&nbsp; Like Frankenstein, we may have 
made our man ill: but we cannot help his being alive; and if he 
destroys us, it is our own fault.</p>
<p>If any reply, that to add a number of uneducated women-voters 
to the number of uneducated men-voters will be only to make the 
danger worse, the answer is:&mdash;That women will be always less
brutal than men, and will exercise on them (unless they are 
maddened, as in the first French Revolution, by the hunger and 
misery of their children) the same softening influence in public 
life which they now exercise in private; and, moreover, that as 
things stand now, the average woman is more <!-- page 21--><a 
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>educated, in 
every sense of the word, than the average man; and that to admit 
women would be to admit a class of voters superior, not inferior,
to the average.</p>
<p>Startling as this may sound to some, I assert that it is 
true.</p>
<p>We must recollect that the just complaints of the insufficient
education of girls proceed almost entirely from that 
&lsquo;lower-upper&rsquo; class which stocks the professions, 
including the Press; that this class furnishes only a small 
portion of the whole number of voters; that the vast majority 
belong (and will belong still more hereafter) to other classes, 
of whom we may say, that in all of them the girls are better 
educated than the boys.&nbsp; They stay longer at 
school&mdash;sometimes twice as long.&nbsp; They are more open to
the purifying and elevating influences of religion.&nbsp; Their 
brains are neither muddled away with drink and profligacy, or 
narrowed by the one absorbing aim of turning a penny into five 
farthings.&nbsp; They have a far larger share than their brothers
of that best of all practical and moral educations, that of 
family life.&nbsp; Any one who has had experience of the families
of farmers and small tradesmen, knows how boorish the lads are, 
beside the intelligence, and often the refinement, of their 
sisters.&nbsp; The same rule holds (I am told) in the 
manufacturing districts.&nbsp; Even in the families of employers,
the young ladies are, and have been for a generation or two, far 
more highly cultivated than their brothers, whose intellects are 
always early absorbed in business, and too often injured by 
pleasure.&nbsp; The same, I believe, in spite of all that has 
been written about the frivolity of the girl of the period, holds
true of that class which is, by a strange irony, called 
&lsquo;the ruling class.&rsquo;&nbsp; I suspect that the average 
young lady <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>already learns more worth knowing at 
home than her brother does at the public school.&nbsp; Those, 
moreover, who complain that girls are trained now too often 
merely as articles for the so-called &lsquo;marriage 
market,&rsquo; must remember this&mdash;that the great majority 
of those who will have votes will be either widows, who have long
passed all that, have had experience, bitter and wholesome, of 
the realities of life, and have most of them given many pledges 
to the State in the form of children; or women who, by various 
circumstances, have been early withdrawn from the competition of 
this same marriage-market, and have settled down into pure and 
honourable celibacy, with full time, and generally full 
inclination, to cultivate and employ their own powers.&nbsp; I 
know not what society those men may have lived in who are in the 
habit of sneering at &lsquo;old maids.&rsquo;&nbsp; My experience
has led me to regard them with deep respect, from the servant 
retired on her little savings to the unmarried sisters of the 
rich and the powerful, as a class pure, unselfish, thoughtful, 
useful, often experienced and able; more fit for the franchise, 
when they are once awakened to their duties as citizens, than the
average men of the corresponding class.&nbsp; I am aware that 
such a statement will be met with &lsquo;laughter, the unripe 
fruit of wisdom.&rsquo;&nbsp; But that will not affect its 
truth.</p>
<p>Let me say a few words more on this point.&nbsp; There are 
those who, while they pity the two millions and a half, or more, 
of unmarried women earning their own bread, are tempted to do no 
more than pity them, from the mistaken notion that after all it 
is their own fault, or at least the fault of nature.&nbsp; They 
ought (it is fancied) to have been married: or at least they 
ought to have been good-looking enough and clever enough to <!-- 
page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
23</span>be married.&nbsp; They are the exceptions, and for 
exceptions we cannot legislate.&nbsp; We must take care of the 
average article, and let the refuse take care of itself.&nbsp; I 
have put plainly, it may be somewhat coarsely, a belief which I 
believe many men hold, though they are too manly to express 
it.&nbsp; But the belief itself is false.&nbsp; It is false even 
of the lower classes.&nbsp; Among them, the cleverest, the most 
prudent, the most thoughtful, are those who, either in domestic 
service or a few&mdash;very few, alas!&mdash;other callings, 
attain comfortable and responsible posts which they do not care 
to leave for any marriage, especially when that marriage puts the
savings of their life at the mercy of the husband&mdash;and they 
see but too many miserable instances of what that implies.&nbsp; 
The very refinement which they have acquired in domestic service 
often keeps them from wedlock.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall never 
marry,&rsquo; said an admirable nurse, the daughter of a common 
agricultural labourer.&nbsp; &lsquo;After being so many years 
among gentlefolk, I could not live with a man who was not a 
scholar, and did not bathe every day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And if this be true of the lower class, it is still more true 
of some, at least, of the classes above them.&nbsp; Many a 
&lsquo;lady&rsquo; who remains unmarried does so, not for want of
suitors, but simply from nobleness of mind; because others are 
dependent on her for support; or because she will not degrade 
herself by marrying for marrying&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; How often 
does one see all that can make a woman attractive&mdash;talent, 
wit, education, health, beauty,&mdash;possessed by one who never 
will enter holy wedlock.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a loss,&rsquo; one 
says, &lsquo;that such a woman should not have married, if it 
were but for the sake of the children she might have borne to the
State.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; answer wise women of 
the world, &lsquo;she did not see any one whom she could 
condescend to many.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
24</span>And thus it is that a very large proportion of the 
spinsters of England, so far from being, as silly boys and wicked
old men fancy, the refuse of their sex, are the very 
<i>&eacute;lite</i> thereof; those who have either sacrificed 
themselves for their kindred, or have refused to sacrifice 
themselves to that longing to marry at all risks of which women 
are so often and so unmanly accused.</p>
<p>Be all this as it may, every man is bound to bear in mind, 
that over this increasing multitude of &lsquo;spinsters,&rsquo; 
of women who are either self-supporting or desirous of so being, 
men have, by mere virtue of their sex, absolutely no rights at 
all.&nbsp; No human being has such a right over them as the 
husband has (justly or unjustly) over the wife, or the father 
over the daughter living in his house.&nbsp; They are independent
and self-supporting units of the State, owing to it exactly the 
same allegiance as, and neither more nor less than, men who have 
attained their majority.&nbsp; They are favoured by no privilege,
indulgence, or exceptional legislation from the State, and they 
ask none.&nbsp; They expect no protection from the State save 
that protection for life and property which every man, even the 
most valiant, expects, since the carrying of side-arms has gone 
out of fashion.&nbsp; They prove themselves daily, whenever they 
have simple fair play, just as capable as men of not being a 
burden to the State.&nbsp; They are in fact in exactly the same 
relation to the State as men.&nbsp; Why are similar relations, 
similar powers, and similar duties not to carry with them similar
rights?&nbsp; To this question the common sense and justice of 
England will have soon to find an answer.&nbsp; I have sufficient
faith in that common sense and justice, when once awakened, to 
face any question fairly, to anticipate what that answer will 
be.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
